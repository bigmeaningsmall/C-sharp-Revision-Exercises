    "### **Bonus Exercise: Create a Simple Game Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Task**:\n",
    "Create a **simple text-based game loop** where the player tries to guess a secret number. The game should:\n",
    "1. **Generate a random number** between 1 and 10.\n",
    "2. Allow the player to **guess the number**.\n",
    "3. Give feedback like **“Too high!”** or **“Too low!”** after each guess.\n",
    "4. **End the game** when the player guesses correctly, and print the number of attempts it took to win.\n",
    "5. Ask the player if they want to **play again** after the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hints**:\n",
    "- Use a **`while` loop** to keep the game running until the correct guess.\n",
    "- Use **`Random`** to generate a random number.\n",
    "- Use an **`if/else` statement** to check the player’s guess and give feedback.\n",
    "- Keep track of the number of attempts with a **variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extra Challenge**:\n",
    "- Add a **limit of 3 attempts** before the player loses.\n",
    "- Add a simple **score system** that rewards the player for guessing correctly on the first try, second try, etc.\n"
