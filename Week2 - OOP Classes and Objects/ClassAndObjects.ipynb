    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviours. An **object** is an instance of a class, where you can set values to the properties and call methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Breakdown:\n",
    "- **Class Definition**: The `Animal` class defines three properties (`Name`, `Species`, `Age`) and one method (`MakeSound()`), which prints a message using the property values.\n",
    "- **Creating Objects**: We create two `Animal` objects (`cat` and `dog`), each with different properties.\n",
    "- **Calling Methods**: Using `cat.MakeSound()` and `dog.MakeSound()` prints the respective messages.\n",

    "### Instructions for Creating Animal Variations Using Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be using **inheritance** to create variations of the `Animal` class. Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, enabling code reusability and extending functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create New Animal Classes**:\n",
    "   - Create new classes like `Cat`, `Bird`, or `Cow`.\n",
    "   - Make these classes **inherit** from the `Animal` class using the syntax `: Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add Unique Methods**:\n",
    "   - Each new class should have a unique method that represents the sound or action of that animal.\n",
    "   - For example, `Cat` could have a `Meow()` method, and `Bird` could have a `Chirp()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Override `MakeSound()`**:\n",
    "   - Override the `MakeSound()` method in each new class to call the unique method you created, just like the `Dog` class uses `Bark()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Objects and Call Methods**:\n",
    "   - Once your new classes are defined, create objects for each and call their `Describe()` and `MakeSound()` methods to see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Inheritance?**\n",
    "- Inheritance lets your new animal classes (`Cat`, `Bird`, etc.) automatically have the same properties (`Name`, `Species`, `Age`) and methods (`Describe()`) as the `Animal` class.\n",
    "- You only need to define the new behaviour specific to each animal, like `Meow()` or `Chirp()`, while still keeping the common functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**:\n",
    "Create at least two new classes that inherit from `Animal`, add unique methods for each class, override `MakeSound()`, and create their objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "// Define the Cat class that inherits from Animal\n",
    "public class Cat : Animal\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public Cat(string name, int age) : base(name, \"Cat\", age) { }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Unique method for Cat\n",
    "    public void Meow()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Console.WriteLine($\"{Name} meows!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Override MakeSound method\n",
    "    public override void MakeSound()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        Meow();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a Cat object and call methods\n",
    "Cat myCat = new Cat(\"Mittens\", 2);\n",
    "myCat.Describe();  // Prints: \"Mittens is a 2 year old Cat.\"\n",
    "myCat.MakeSound(); // Prints: \"Mittens meows!\"\n",

    "## Thinking About Inheritance in Game Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Youâ€™ve just built animal classes using **inheritance**. Thatâ€™s not the end of the story. Itâ€™s the beginning of learning how to structure larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is about deciding *when it makes sense* to share code across different objects. In game development, thatâ€™s an ongoing design process: sometimes a base class makes things clean and reusable, other times composition or interfaces are a better fit. The key is to recognise the relationships between objects and how they should behave.\n",
    "Learning through prototyping and iteration helps us work out what works best in different scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Uses of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Characters and Enemies**\n",
    "  Start with a `Character` base class that holds shared properties like health, speed, and position. From there, make `Player`, `Enemy`, or `NPC` subclasses with their own actions (`Attack()`, `Defend()`, `Patrol()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vehicles in a Racing Game**\n",
    "  A `Vehicle` base class might define acceleration and steering. Subclasses like `Car`, `Bike`, or `Truck` adjust these behaviours to feel unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Items in a Shop or Inventory**\n",
    "  Begin with an `Item` class for name, cost, and description. Subclasses like `Weapon`, `Potion`, or `KeyItem` extend it with effects or restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Employees in a Simulation**\n",
    "  A base `Employee` with `Name` and `Salary` could branch into `Manager` or `Developer`, each with different responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Game Example: The Zoo Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a zoo management game. You could:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a base `Animal` class for shared details like `Name`, `Age`, and `Eat()`.\n",
    "* Derive subclasses such as `Lion`, `Penguin`, and `Elephant`.\n",
    "* Override `MakeSound()` or add special methods (`Swim()`, `Trumpet()`, `Hunt()`).\n",
    "* Use polymorphism so your zoo can handle all animals through the same interface, while still allowing unique behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure lets you add new animals without rewriting your zooâ€™s core logic â€” just extend the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusability**: Write shared code once.\n",
    "* **Maintainability**: Change the base class, and improvements ripple through all subclasses.\n",
    "* **Extensibility**: Add new types without breaking old ones.\n",
