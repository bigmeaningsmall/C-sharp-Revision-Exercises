    "#### **What is an Event?**\n",
    "An **event** in C# is a way for an object (the publisher) to notify other objects (subscribers) when something of interest occurs. Events are built upon **delegates** and are used extensively for handling user interactions, state changes, and inter-object communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use Events?**\n",
    "- When you want a class to **broadcast a message** to other classes without knowing who the recipients are.\n",
    "- To implement a **subscriber-publisher model** where one object raises an event, and others respond to it.\n",
    "- For scenarios like UI controls (e.g., button clicks), game mechanics (e.g., receiving damage), and real-time notifications.\n",
