    "### **Interface Tutorial: Part 1 - Understanding Interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is an Interface?**\n",
    "An **interface** in C# is like a contract that defines a set of methods or properties that a class must implement. \n",
    "However, it doesn’t contain any implementation details itself. \n",
    "Interfaces are used to define behaviours that can be shared across multiple classes, making your code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use Interfaces?**\n",
    "- When you want to enforce certain methods to be implemented by multiple classes.\n",
    "- To establish common functionality between unrelated classes.\n",
    "- To enable **polymorphism**, allowing you to treat different objects in a consistent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Defining an Interface**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating an interface called `IDamagable`. This interface will have a single method `TakeDamage(int amount)` which can be implemented by any class that needs to react to damage in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "// Define the IDamagable interface\n",
    "public interface IDamagable\n",
    "{\n",
    "    void TakeDamage(int amount);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
   ]

   "source": [
    "### **Instructions:**\n",
    "1. **Type out the code above** into a new Polyglot C# notebook cell.\n",
    "2. **Run the cell** to see how the interface is defined.\n",
    "3. The `IDamagable` interface doesn’t do anything on its own because it doesn’t have an implementation—only a definition. In the next step, we will create classes that implement this interface."
